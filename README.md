# jimsrules

This repository is the place to help improve [Jim's Rules](https://www.jimsrules.com), Jim Leonardo's website dedicated to discussing all things software development.

This repository is **not** the source code of [jimsrules.com](https://www.jimsrules.com). That's currently a private repository to avoid some messiness I haven't figured out with the publishing process that would probably lead to confusion.

If you see typos, have an issue with the app rendering, or have an idea on something you'd like to see covered, etc., please add an issue in the [issues list](https://github.com/jimsrules/jimsrules/issues).

You also can view the plan for content and site enhancements over at [Jim's Rules Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/jimsrules/projects/1). I make no promises though!

Thanks for reading Jim's Rules and contributing to making it better!
